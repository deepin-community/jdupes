jdupes for Debian
-----------------

jdupes can be compiled with the -DENABLE_BTRFS to add support to btrfs
filesystem. However, this option uses the file linux/btrfs.h, not available
for hurd-i386 and kfreebsd-*. So, jdupes has support to btrfs on all Linux
based architectures only.

To see if jdupes build is supporting btrfs, use 'jdupes -v' command.
